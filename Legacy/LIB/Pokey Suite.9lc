!! Program: PKSSoundTest
!! Purpose: Simple, simple test that we can do. Parameters are as follows:
!!
!!	REG9: Base address of Pokey.
!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
program PKSoundTest
declarations
	assign REG1 to BaseAddr
	assign REG2 to AddrToWrite

	!! Base address
	BaseAddr = REG9

	AddrToWrite = BaseAddr
	AddrToWrite = AddrToWrite inc 16

	write @AddrToWrite = 00
	write @AddrToWrite = 03

	write @BaseAddr = 55

	AddrToWrite = BaseAddr
	AddrToWrite = AddrToWrite inc

	write @AddrToWrite = AF		!! Pure tone is heard
	REG8 = 10
	execute PKSPause
	write @AddrToWrite = 0		!! turn it off


	!! There are 3 other channels to test. This
	!! is pretty well documented in Atari's documentation.
	!! You should expand this to suit your needs.

!! Program: PKSPause
!! Purpose: Pause for a short time. REG8
!!	It would be better to put a generic function like this in 
!!	a global routine/because you're going to use it in other programs.

program PKSPause

	REG1 = REG8
dloop:
	dec REG1
	if REG1 > 0 goto dloop
